## SkySphere

**SkySphere** is a lightweight JavaScript sky map for HTML5 canvas.

It's written in pure Vanilla JavaScript, no plugins are required! All in only 25 kB!

Works also on touchscreen devices.

You can simply add it on your page or load it in the AMD way.

    <canvas id="sky"></canvas>
    
    <script>var sky = new SkySphere('sky');</script>

You can customize it adding your custom objects to the map. You can also add a custom function to call when clicking on this objects.

For the full list of options take a look to the example or read the documentation.

## Contributors notes

Builded using grunt.

It's at the first version, it could contains some bugs. Please, report me any problems!
